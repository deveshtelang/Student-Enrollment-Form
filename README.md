# Student-Enrollment-Form

In this project, I have designed a Student Enrollm"ent Form to input the student details using a HTML form and store the information collected in a database managed by using JsonPowerDB. 

**TITLE OF THE PROJECT**
The project title is "Student Enrollment Form". It stores student details such as Roll_No, Name, Address, Enrollment_date, and BirthDate with three buttons "Save", "Reset" and "Update" to perform the respective operations. 

**DESCRIPTION**
I have created an HTML form where the input is taken from the user and that input is validated as per the criteria set to store the values in a database Student-DB using powerful JsonPowerDB. The default focus will be on the Student Roll_no text box and every time a button is clicked the focus comes back to the Student Roll_no text box.
The three buttons used in the form have their respective tasks:
"Save" : The button will save the details in the Student-Table inside the Student-DB. 
"Update" : This button is used to update the records if any need arises. 
"Reset" " This button is used to reset the contents of the form to empty. Also, every time save or update button is clicked the function resetForm() will automatically be called to reset the contents to empty.
